    <p id="about1">My name is Anna, and I study Digital Media and Sociology at the University of Glasgow. Born 1998 in Vienna, Austria, and raised in Denmark, I spend most of her time outside University working on graphic design and audio-visual projects. In 2017 she co-founded the online audio magazine 'LYD', where she writes, creates graphics and maintains the website. She's also active in GUST, GUCFS, and occassionally contributes to GUM.</p>
      <p id="about2">I am really interested in visual design, and architecture especially. Brutalism is especially interesting from a sociological viewpoint, considering the utopian ideals connected to it. Although it tends to be hated, I also think the stark functionalist aesthetic can also be a nice minimalist departure from the more modern lego-like glass buildings.</p>
